  <p class="img-text"> The OSU FEH Robot project is a semester long robotic design project focusing on multidisciplinary design, development and documentation. I worked with a teammate to create software for an embedded system that communicated with various sensors and positioning systems to navigate a course and complete objectives. During the course of the project we kept track of our robot, nicknamed 'Cow-Bot' for the QR code used for it's positioning.
